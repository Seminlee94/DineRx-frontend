# DineRx ðŸ’ŠðŸ’ŠðŸ’Š

## Aboutâœ…
- I was inspired to do this project while working as a Nursing Assistant at trauma 1 hospital. I've seen many frustration in patients' eyes when they had to wait 10~15 minutes each time they call cafeteria to order their meal. With DineRx, patients now can order food online, and educate themselves about their diet as they order. 

- Patients' diets can change several times throughout their stay in the hospital. If they have a surgery scheduled, they would be placed in NPO, which means no food is allowed until further notice. A lot of patients don't know what NPO is, as well as what other diets, such as Cariac diet or Low-Sodium diet. With DineRx, patients can learn about their diet in their free time and see more importance of eating healthy. 

## Included Featuresâœ…
- User can log in using Google Map API/Auto Completion to search for their hospital.
- User can add item to the cart, view more details of the item, which includes ingredients and nutritions of the item.
- User can add items to either "order now", or "order ahead," where they can choose the date and time for the food to be delivered. 
- User can view the ordered items
- User can view the education page about their diet.

#### This is Order ahead page. Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner are all in one page, so patients can easily scroll up and down, and use the button to scroll to the top. If the meal is for breakfast, breakfast button will be shown upon hover. If the meal is for lunch and dinner, lunch and dinner buttons will be shown.
